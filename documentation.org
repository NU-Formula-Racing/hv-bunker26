Find ways of reading esp32 printf data from usb port to UART

Meeting on Nov 12: 
Fact check if stm32 do usb full speeed, make sure USB to UART chip can talk over USB full speed. 
ESP32 talk to UART at 3.3V, so the chip has to be able to talk at 3.3V; USB always have to be 5V. The chip should have two different power supplies.
